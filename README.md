- âš¡ Fun fact: The mascot of GitHub is a female cat with 5 octopus-like arms. It was created by freelance graphic designer Simon Oxley (who also designed Twitterâ€™s bird) to sell on iStock. GitHub became interested in his work named Octopuss. They bought exclusive rights and renamed it to Octocat.
